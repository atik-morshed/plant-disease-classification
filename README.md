# Plant Disease Classification using Deep Learning

A comprehensive deep learning project for plant disease classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This project demonstrates the application of computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify various plant diseases from images.

## 🌱 Project Overview

This project implements a CNN-based image classifier that can predict plant diseases from leaf images. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset and can classify multiple plant species and their associated diseases.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the **PlantVillage Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains:
- **38 different classes** of plant diseases
- **Color, grayscale, and segmented** image versions
- **Multiple plant species** including Apple, Grape, Potato, Tomato, and more
- **High-quality images** suitable for deep learning applications
